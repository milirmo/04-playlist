            <br>I'm a puppet on a string
            <br>Tracy Island, time-travelin' diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
            <br>Come to find you four in some velvet mornin' years too late
            <br>She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space
            <br>In my mind, when she's not right there beside me
        </p>
        <p>
           <br>I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
           <br>And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
           <br>And I can't help myself
           <br>All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Well, are you mine?
            <br>Are you mine?
            <br>Are you mine? Oh, ah
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>I guess what I'm tryin' to say is I need the deep end
            <br>Keep imaginin' meetin', wished away entire lifetimes
            <br>Unfair we're not somewhere misbehavin' for days
            <br>Great escape, lost track of time and space
            <br>She's a silver linin', climbin' on my desire
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
            <br>And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
            <br>And I can't help myself
            <br>All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"
            <br>Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
            <br>Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
            <br>Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
            <br>So in case I'm mistaken, I
            <br>Just wanna hear you say, "You got me baby"
            <br>"Are you mine?"
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space
            <br>In my mind, when she's not right there beside me
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
            <br>And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
            <br>And I can't help myself
            <br>All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"
            <br>Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
            <br>Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
            <br>Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)
